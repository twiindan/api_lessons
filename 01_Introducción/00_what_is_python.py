# From Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) ):
#
#     Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design
#     philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python's syntax allows programmers
#     to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
#     such as C, and the language provides constructs intended to enable clear
#     programs on both a small and large scale.
#
#     Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
#     imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic
#     type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive
#     standard library.
