# Python ordered sequence types (arrays in other languages, not linked lists):
#  - They are arrays, not linked lists, so they have constant O(1) time for index access
#  - list:
#     - Comma-separated with square brackets
#     - Mutable
#  - tuple:
#     - Comma-separated with parentheses
#     - Parentheses only required in empty tuple
#     - Immutable
#     - Slightly better traversing performance than lists
#  - str and unicode:
#     - One or three single or double quotes
#     - They have special methods
#     - Immutable
