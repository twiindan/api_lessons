         'created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design ' \
         'philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks ' \
         'rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer ' \
